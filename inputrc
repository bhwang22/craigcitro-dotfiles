# (2010 Oct 23) I continue to have problems with these bits -- I
# discovered that ^ (caret, name included for finding this file when
# searching) was behaving oddly, all because of (1) these two bindings
# and (2) possibly the $include /etc/inputrc.

# I kind of want to try out the incremental forward/reverse search,
# but I like the current behavior I have. Maybe M-r, M-s?

# I don't know why, but these don't seem to work. Figure it out later.

# At some point meta started giving me trouble in XTerm;

# These changes are paired with some in my .Xdefaults.
