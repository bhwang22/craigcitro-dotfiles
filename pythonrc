# the rlcompleter is necessary, even though we don't explicitly use
# it: importing it actually creates the completer we use and sets it
# appropriately. we also can't delete it, because otherwise the
# completer fails to work. so we import it under a different name in
# order to avoid (1) polluting the global namespace and (2)
# potentially breaking something if we do want to import it at
# runtime.
import readline
import rlcompleter as _rlcompleter
import codecs

# set tab to autocomplete, which is far superior to, uh, tab.
# we need different versions based on what architecture we're on.
#
# (2010 Oct 04) Interestingly, this spontaneously stopped working on
# my work MBP. I'm not sure if this is a difference between my two
# laptops or what; I need to investigate. In the interim, just turn it
# off.
#
# (2010 Oct 18) Unfortunately, the plot thickens. It seems that it's
# impossible to determine what readline library you've got in place by
# looking at the __doc__ on the file, and I seem to get inconsistent
# results with the behavior of the system readline. In particular,
# there seem to be *two* system-built Python installs on my laptop:
#
#  * /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/...
#    Has GNU readline style parse_and_bind processing
#    Has the `readline.get_history_item(0) is None` bug
#
#  * /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/...
#    Has libedit style parse_and_bind processing
#    Does *not* have the `readline.get_history_item(0) is None` bug
#
# I want a programmatic way to tell these apart. Oh, here's something
# interesting: the libedit-based readline seems to return its results
# in a different order than the GNU one. Is that an implementation
# detail of rlcompleter? I'm not sure.
#
# FINALLY, a win. Here's what we can do: if we're not on a Mac, we
# know that we've got GNU readline. (Well, assuming that we're either
# on Mac or Linux.) So in the case that we're on a Mac, we can run
# `otool -L` on `readline.so` itself and grep for `libreadline`. If we
# find it, we've got GNU readline; otherwise, we've got libedit.
#
# (2010 Oct 25) Oh, but there's always more to it. Of course, there's
# a possibility I didn't consider above: what if readline was
# *statically* linked, not dynamically. Duh ... so try `nm -u` to see
# what we see.

#
# It all has to occur in my .pdbrc/.pdbrc.py, unfortunately. This
# configuration is still not nearly complete -- I need to make sure
# that it actually uses the frame locals appropriately, and I'd really
# like to have the pdb history be maintained separately from the rest
# of the interpreter history. I'll probably need to figure out what
# entry/exit hooks pdb/bdb offer to make this happen.
